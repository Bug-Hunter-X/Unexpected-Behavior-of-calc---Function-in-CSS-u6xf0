The CSS code has an unexpected behavior when using the `calc()` function with percentages and other units. For example, the following code will not work as expected:

```css
.element { 
  width: calc(50% - 10px); 
}
```

The expected behavior is that the element's width should be 50% of its parent's width minus 10 pixels. However, the actual behavior is that the element's width is 50% of its parent's width, and then 10 pixels are subtracted from that value. This can lead to unexpected layout issues.

Another example where there might be issues is when dealing with nested `calc()` functions. Suppose you have a CSS rule like this:

```css
.element { 
  width: calc(calc(50% - 10px) + 20px); 
}
```

In this case, the result might be unexpected because the nested `calc()` functions might not be evaluated correctly.
