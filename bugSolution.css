To solve the unexpected behavior of the `calc()` function, you can try one of the following solutions:

1. Avoid using percentages and other units together within the `calc()` function. For example, instead of writing:

```css
.element { 
  width: calc(50% - 10px); 
}
```

You can write:

```css
.element { 
  width: 50%; 
  margin-right: 10px; 
}
```

2. Avoid using nested `calc()` functions. For example, instead of writing:

```css
.element { 
  width: calc(calc(50% - 10px) + 20px); 
}
```

You can write:

```css
.element { 
  width: calc(50% + 10px); 
}
```

3. Use a JavaScript library to handle complex calculations. This is usually not recommended, and often a clear indicator that your CSS is too complex and should be refactored.
